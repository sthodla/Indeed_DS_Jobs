# Diving into the Data Science Job Market
## By: Shrikar Thodla, Dillon Quan


In this project we used scraped data science job postings from Indeed, along with a ![kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sl6149/data-scientist-job-market-in-the-us), in order to find out what skills, titles, and locations were most popular. Visualizations were made using ggplot2, scraping and data manipulation were done in Python and pandas. Below are some of the visualizations from our presentation. I highly recommend taking a quick look at the ![full presentation](MSDS_EDA_Final_Presentation_Dillon_Shrikar.pdf) to see all the visualizations and hopefully you learn something new!
